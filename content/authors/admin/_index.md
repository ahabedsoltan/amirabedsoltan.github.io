My current research focuses on understanding the generalization behavior of machine learning model classes and their scaling behavior. I have developed an algorithm to scale kernel methods to millions of centers, establishing a state-of-the-art method. In general, I am interested in exploring the depths of machine learning and its applications.

Prior to joining UCSD for my Ph.D., I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California and my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering from Sharif University.
